I’m a software engineer with a passion for diving headfirst into the madness of programming 💻. My main weapons of choice are Zig, Golang, and Python 🐍, though I’m also stuck wrangling databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL 🗄️, dabbling with Redis 🔴, and dealing with the many joys of AWS services ☁️ (because why not add cloud chaos to the mix?).

When I’m not elbow-deep in code 👨‍💻, you can usually find me obsessing over lower-level computer science concepts, because apparently, I enjoy learning how things really break under the hood 🔧🤯.

Outside of the tech world, I like to get my hands dirty—literally—with my diesel trucks 🚚🔩. There's something satisfying about fixing a machine that doesn’t give you cryptic error messages ❌. It’s a nice change of pace from debugging code that insists on betraying you 😤.

This blog is where I vent about my latest coding frustrations, share what I’ve learned 📚, and maybe provide some helpful advice along the way. Stick around if you want to hear about the ups and downs of life as a software engineer (and probably a few truck repair stories too) 🚀🔧.
